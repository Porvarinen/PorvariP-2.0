# PorvariP-2.0
(There is 3 versions of my map so you can chose)
Install: 
step 1. open PorvariP2.0 file and you will see 3 other folders, chose 1 of those
step 2. move Stream and _resource to this main folder
step 3. delete unwated folders and you should have only 1 file path
step 4. just drop the PorvariP2.0 in your server resources and and it to your server.cfg and add line: start PorvariP2.0
enjoy!
(XML is included but read Lisences!)
remember that this can lower your severs FPS if you have already lots of plugins
